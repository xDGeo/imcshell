# IMCSH (IMC Shell) - A Custom Linux Shell

## 📌 Project Overview

IMCSH (**IMC Shell**) is a lightweight command-line shell written in **C** as part of the **Operating Systems (WS 2024/25)** course project. It allows users to execute system commands, run background processes, redirect output to files, and manage active processes.

This project demonstrates key concepts of **process management**, **system calls**, and **shell programming** in Linux.
